# Tip Calculator
* A Tip Calculator is a calculator that calculates a tip based on the percentage of the total bill.
* We create a form in order to enter the preferred amount:
* You design the style however you want. You can also use CSS to hide the results and show them through JavaScript after the user fills in the form:
* We add an onchange event. The onchange event occurs when the user interacts with the form.

This action will execute a function that computes the final bill amount based on the percentage tip, then returns the results.
